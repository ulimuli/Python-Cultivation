Python-Cultivation

A cultivation game inspired by cultivation novels from all types of sources

In this game you are currently able to:

Join Sects – Become part of a sect and improve your relations to earn cultivation rewards.

Improve Sect rank - from outer disciple to inner, to core, and even to a sect elder. For this, you will need to complete 12 unique tasks to help your sect.

Explore the World – Visit different locations and experience random events.

Advance Your Cultivation – Progress through cultivation realms up to Void Refinement, the highest realm currently available. Advancing requires 45 upgrades, with each step becoming progressively harder.

Be careful, as sometimes you can experience backlash from reaching a new realm.

Cultivate – Train and grow stronger on the path of cultivation.

Simple Combat – Fight against one of five enemies and try to win with a higher combat power.

Increase your Combat Power by reaching a higher cultivation realm or by improving your realm-exclusive activities.

Increase the size of your Qi, improve its quality, build a core, increase the size of your nascent soul, expand your own domain, and finally, reach a connection with the Dao.

Includes an interactive GUI, which is mostly usable via button clicks for now, unfortunately.

Currently, there is a small bug with the GUI. I am not sure what causes this, but it seems that on Windows, the text field is bigger than on my Mac. I will try to fix this bug as soon as possible.

For any Ideas or Bugs you have please write them to me as i would really appreciate them. :)
